                            | 14. | A nurse is preparing a plan of care for an older adult client who is receiving sulfonamide therapy. Which of the following would the nurse include in the plan of care to reduce the likelihood of causing renal damage? Select all that apply. |
                            |   | A) | Administer sulfonamides once daily. |
                            |   | B) | Increase fluid intake up to 2000 mL if tolerated. |
                            |   | C) | Use sulfonamides cautiously in clients with renal impairment. |
                            |   | D) | Administer the dose intravenously instead of orally. |
                            |   | E) | Ask the prescriber to change the medication ordered. |
                            |   | Ans: | B, C |
                            |   | Feedback: |
                            |   | Older adults experience a decline in renal function with aging. Therefore, sulfonamides must be used cautiously in older clients. In addition, increasing fluid intake up to 2000 mL daily can decrease the likelihood of causing renal damage in older clients. The drug is administered throughout the day, not as a once-daily dose. Sulfonamides can affect renal function regardless of the route administered. Asking the prescriber to change the medication ordered may be appropriate but is not necessary as long as the drug is administered cautiously and the client is monitored closely. |

                                    |   | When warfarin and sulfonamides are given concomitantly, an increase in action of the anticoagulant is seen, leading to an increase in clotting time, such as PT/INR, and an increased risk of bleeding. An increased risk of infection and a decrease in the white blood cell count would occur when a sulfonamide is given with methotrexate. The combination of warfarin and sulfonamide does not impact the effect of the antibiotic. |

                                      |   | While providing care to a client receiving sulfasalazine therapy for ulcerative colitis, the nurse should regularly inspect all stool samples and record their number and appearance. Yellow skin or urine in clients receiving sulfasalazine is normal, and the nurse should not stop the dosage. Sulfasalazine is administered with meals or immediately afterward, not on an empty stomach. Administering cranberry juice is helpful for clients with urinary tract infections, but not for clients with ulcerative colitis. |

                                        |   | Clients may develop gastrointestinal distress such as diarrhea if they have consumed extremely large doses of cranberry juice. The recommended dose is 6 ounces of juice twice daily. Cranberry juice on an empty stomach or immediately after dosage will not lead to diarrhea if taken in the recommended amount. Minimized food and fluid intake or lack of exercise does not increase the chances of diarrhea. Crystalluria does not cause diarrhea. |

Anaphylactic shock and leukopenia are some of the adverse reactions of sulfonamides but are not associated with mixing sulfonamides and anticoagulants. Oral anticoagulants do not decrease the effectiveness of sulfonamides. |

                                                |   | The nurse should encourage a client to wear protective clothing while going out in the sun to reduce the effect of photosensitivity. While increasing the fluid intake is recommended, it does not help combat the effects of photosensitivity. There is no need to avoid lights while indoors; the skin becomes sensitive only to harsh sunlight during sulfonamide therapy. Wearing protective footwear may protect the feet from injury, but it will not protect the skin from the harmful effects of photosensitivity. |

                                                            |   | A client with a urinary tract infection already is experiencing an alteration in urinary elimination. Because one adverse effect of the sulfonamide drugs is altered elimination patterns, it is important to help the client maintain adequate fluid intake and output. The nurse would encourage clients to increase fluid intake to 2000 mL or more per day to prevent crystalluria and stones (calculi) forming in the genitourinary tract, as well as to aid in removing microorganisms from the urinary tract. It is important to measure and record the client’s intake and output every 8 hours and notify the primary health care provider if the urinary output decreases or the client fails to increase his or her oral intake. If the client is unable to maintain adequate intake, then he or she would be at risk for fluid imbalance. If renal injury would occur, then the client would be at risk for ineffective renal perfusion. Bladder training would be an appropriate intervention to address stress incontinence. |

The client is correct in taking the drug with a large glass of water each time, finishing the full prescription, and calling the doctor if symptoms get worse. |

Therefore, Risk for Infection would be the most appropriate nursing diagnosis. Impaired Urinary Elimination would be appropriate if the client was experiencing changes in urinary output. Impaired Skin Integrity would be appropriate if the client developed a rash or hypersensitivity reaction. Deficient Knowledge would be appropriate if the client lacked understanding of the drug therapy, which is not evident in this situation. |

Increasing fluid intake helps to reduce the risk for their development. Fluids will have no effect on the development of photosensitivity or maintaining blood counts. Although fluids help to minimize the risk for dehydration, this is not the reason for increasing fluid intake with sulfonamide therapy. |
